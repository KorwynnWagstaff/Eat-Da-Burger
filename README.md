# Eat-Da-Burger

This app lets you "devour" burgers that you, the user can populate.

When one runs the app, you can see the existing burgers, if any, on the left and the "devoured ones on the right.

Right below that, there is a space where one can eat whatever burger they please by clicking the "Add Burger" below the input space.
